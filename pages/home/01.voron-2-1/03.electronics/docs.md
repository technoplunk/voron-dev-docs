# Voron Electronics
## Content
[TOC]
## Basics
Generally, follow the manual when building the Voron, when in doubt either check the [Voron Manual Errata](/ej9YJYuDRgKU3fMNmbGi_g) or ask for advice in the [Voron Discord](https://discord.gg/wfwFKuf)

A few useful tips:
* Depending on your level of expertise it may be useful to practice crimping and soldering before wiring everything up. Bad crimps are a major source of problems later on an sometimes hard to identify!
* Safety
    * Mains cables should be properly dimensioned. Use at least 20 AWG for mains connections, even better would be 18 AWG.
    * Buy a quality SSR (see [Official Sourcing Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QS80JOHcgBIABJrAD7sIsVr5nARIzHsFrJnI4P4npgs/))!
    * Add a 135Â°C thermofuse to your bed heater as an additional safety measure.
    * Connect ground to your bed!
* Connectors
    * The recommended MicroFit 3.0 connectors are specced up to 5A and should be used for all connections to the stepper motors, hotend and limit switches 
    * The dupont connectors are used for connections to the RAMPS board
    * Adding molex connectors to all stepper motors is useful. You can disconnect motors while moving the gantry manually to avoid damage to the RAMPS board.
    * 230V setups can can use the MicroFit connectors to connectorize the bed. For 110V ....
* Cables
    * The specced silicone wire has been chosen because:
        * It is high strand
        * Silicone insulation withstands heat and is more flexible which is good in high movement applications
* PWM
    * All PWM ports on the RAMPS board are switched on GND. Therefore, it is OK to use a single V+ line to connect multiple fans and share V+ among heater and probe.
    * Hence, a single step-down board is sufficient in 24V setups
* Wiring
    * Check you cable loom before installing the tape chains. You need at least (common V+ for fans, common V+ for probe/heater)
        * 8x 24AWG wires in the z chain (2 steppers)
        * 4x 24AWG wires in the y chain (endstops)
        * 7x 24AWG (probe, fans, thermistor) 
        * 2x 20AWG in the x chain (heater)
    * You may add additional wires to your cable chains as a replacement in chase of wire breaks. However, these cables will be heated/cooled and moved around as much as your live cables and may be broken already when you need them!
    * X/Y endstop connector can be strapped to the bottom of the joint. Just make sure the cable is long enough
    * Buy some cable holders (e.g. with adhesive) to organize your cables in the electronics compartment
    * Cables can be hidden in the rails. Optionally print cable covers for the rails
* Display
    * Some display extension boards have loose connectors. Ensure that all pins have a solid connection
    * Sometimes EXT1 and EXT2 have to be exchanged
    * Sometimes EXT1 and EXT2 connectors are on 180 degrees from the correct orientations and thus are keyed the wrong way for the cables
    * Some displays come with very dark backlight. You may have to adjust contrast on the LCD. Depending on the display this may require desoldering
* RPi Power
    * Some step-down boards do not supply enough amps to reliably run the RPi. Sometimes you get undervoltage warnings, sometimes printing is flaky with strange errors (MCU communiation, etc.)
    * The best option to ensure stable power is a separate 5V PSU (e.g. RSP-XX-5V) connected to the USB (either via stripped USB cable or soldered to the pads [PP2 5V and PP3/PP4/PP5 GND](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/schematics/rpi_SCH_3bplus_1p0_reduced.pdf)). Do NOT supply power through GPIO pins. This circumvents fuses and is more likely to damage your pi.
* Motor Positions
    * Z motor positions start in the front left corner and advance clock wise.
    * The "A Drive" motor is located on the right hand side.

## Sourcing
Follow the [Sourcing Guidlines](https://hackmd.io/P_XMpxHGRCe9__FdwCZJsg?view#Sourcing) and the [Official Sourcing Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QS80JOHcgBIABJrAD7sIsVr5nARIzHsFrJnI4P4npgs/) to buy Voron parts.

:::info
The sourcing sheet is copy protected on purpose to prevent outdated copies. This way the development team can guarantee an up-to-date sheet
:::

Make sure to buy Arduino Megas with ATMega16U2 Chips to ease your Klipper installation. Many cheap china clones use CH340 with a standard ID that will make Klipper installation less convenient.


## Offical controller setup

The official supported controller setup is a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with 2x RAMPS 1.4 on Ardunino MEGA boards connected via USB. Furthermore, 7x A4988 drivers are used.

Deviate from this setup at your own risk! A few options used in the community are described below, but official support is limited to the standard RAMPS setup.

## Useful modifications 
### Hall effect endstop
A contact free tuneable alternative to the standard KW10 switches as X/Y endstops is the [Hall Effect XY Endstop](https://github.com/mzbotreprap/VORON/tree/master/PCB/XY%20Endstop).

The hall effect endstop is entirely optional, but may provide more room in the build room if tuned properly. You will have to source and build these on your own. 

### 24V Voron
Standard RAMPS 1.4 mod includes
* Replace the poly fuses with 24V fuses. Multiple ways:
    * Individual fuses, e.g., car fuses with appropriate amperage
    * Simply brigde the connections and add an inline fuse to the ramps board. Voron 2.1 uses a mains heater, individual fuses are therefore not required
* Remove diode D2 to protect the Ardunio Mega board

With 24V you either need to source
* 24V fans or use a step-down / additional 12V PSU for 12V fans
* 24V heater for the hotend
* (Optional) an appropriate step-down to power the RPi

:::info
24V fans for hotend cooling (e.g. Delta, Sunon) and parts cooling (e.g. 3dsway via Aliexpress) are available. However, no 24V electronics fan alternative is known!
:::


### Alternative controller setups
Instead of 2x RAMPS with Arduino MEGAs some Vorons run alternative MCUs either for 32bit or a tighter package 
* SKR 1.3
* MKS sBASE
* MKS Gen 1.4


:::warning
Alternative controllers are not supported by the dev team! You are on your own to figure out the klipper config. Still, community members may share their configuration.
:::

### Unsupported controller setups
* SKR Mini E3 : This board has serious design flaws. The board does not feature this spec GLCD for LCD panel. Poor motor layout and small copper cooling.
